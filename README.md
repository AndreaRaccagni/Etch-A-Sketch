# Etch-A-Sketch

Browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

It has been created with the help of my 5 years old daughter Celeste.
She choose all the images and almost all the colors, so if want to let us know anything about the style, please reach out to her.

## Credits
